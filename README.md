The goal of this project is purely educational to both learn Rust and also learn more about systems programming/writing an emulator. This emulator uses NTSC timing.

The emulator supports the following mappers:
- [Mapper_000](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NROM) ([List of Games](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=0))
- [Mapper_002](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/UxROM) ([List of Games](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=2))
- [Mapper_003](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_003) ([List of Games](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=3))
- [Mapper_066](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/GxROM) ([List of Games](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/search.php?ines=66))
